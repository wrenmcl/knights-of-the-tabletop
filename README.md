# Knights of the Tabletop

This is a board game I have been working on since the Covid lockdowns. It's almost complete soI'm publishing it with the hopes that other people will emjoy it and maybe develop their own versions and rules. I'm releasing it under Creative Commons CC-0 license so please feel free to change it up, I'll be interested to see how it developes with other people's ideas!

# Making the parts

There will be a number of different ways to make the parts for this game, but the primary method right now is laser cutting.

I have plans for nicer, 3D printed versions in the future and the STLs will be added here when ready. You can also go back to the draft version of the rulebook doc and use the paper printed versions if you want a much simpler make.

## The Board

The board is cut from 3mm laser ply. Partial cuts make up the squares throughout the board. This is then overlaid with an engraving pass to add the text, numbers and other demarkations on the board. Finally, a full cut around the outside and also through the middle if you want to make a folding board.

## The game pieces

The game pieces are cut from 3mm acrylic sheet , each side in a different colour. The symbols on the pieces are all engraved and then the circles are all cut out. Start with the inner (smaller) circles first and then move to the outer ones after. Once all is cut out, you then need to glue the rings to the shields and the soldier pucks to the base pucks. The idea is that the shield with the ring attached should slot over the top of the solider, covering the smaller puck completely.

The castles  should also be glued, a plain base layer on the bottom and then a detail layer on top.

## Trap cards

These are printed on a conventional printer as needed.

## Other

You'll also need two dice!
